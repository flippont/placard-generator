### Disclamer
The code is likely rather buggy.</br> 
If there are any problems related to the software, please contact me.

### How to use
The screen is divided into two sections. The side bar, on the left hand side of the screen, and the preview on the right hand side of the screen</br>
Start by going to the input at the top of the sidebar, and type out the name of the country you want to make a placard for. You can enter the [shortened version](#-shortened-country-name) of the country name, or the full country name here. </br>
The output textarea below that, is there to show the countries you have selected in a list. You do have the option to edit this instead of the input above, for more efficiency. To edit this input to create placards, you have to type the name of the country in the [shortened version](#-shortened-country-name) and you have to separate countries with commas. If you put a space in between, it will break it. Once you are done typing, **always** click the button that says **"Save list from textarea"**.</br>
Once you are happy with the list of countries you have created, click the **"Generate"** button to get a preview of the placards. 

#### Details
The details for the placards are edited in the inputs below. If you already have a preview of the placards on the side, you can edit the values to see the values update real time.</br>
There's a slider in the centre of the screen right at the bottom. If you get it, your cursor should change. If you drag that you can change the size of the side bar for easier viewing.

#### Printing
There are 3 things you need to be aware of when printing the placards. That is to:</br> 
a) Remember to click the generate button before hand</br>
b) Make sure all the images have loaded in the preview. If it isn't loading, try checking the Wi-Fi.</br>
c) That you are printing in A4, or else it won't work

if you reload the page while printing, the inputs might break. If this happens, open a new tab, then load the page again.

#### <a id="head1234"></a> Shortened Country Name
The country names that are stored are shortened. This means, that characters are abreviated where possible, and words that add nothing to the country name are removed.</br>
For example, **Central African Republic** would become **CAR**, **Vatican City** would become **Vatican** and **North Korea** would be **NKorea** 

(Note: Some countries are abbreviated even when they are not in the shortened version E.g, DPRK.)
