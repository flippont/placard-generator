### Requirements
* A modern browser (Tested on Chrome)
* File explorer (optional)
* Internet

### Disclamer
The code is likely rather buggy.</br> 
If there are any problems related to the software, please contact me.

### How to use
At it's core, the only thing necessary for the program to function as it should is the bar of buttons and textboxes in line with the textbox with the place holder "Enter a country name"
To use the program,ou can enter the [shortened version](#-shortened-country-name) of the country name, or the full country name onto this textbox and hit enter or click the "Add" button. If you want to generate more than one flag at a time you can specify the amount with the number input beside the textbox.</br>
The button besides that are mainly for exporting. The share button prompts you to share the current placard configuration as a URL. The checkbox that appears when you do so, is for printer only mode, where the person who follows the link is unable to edit the predetermined configuration of placards.
</br>
The two joined buttons are for changing views, where you can toggle list and grid view. This is more of an accessability feature than a utility one. The clear list button, does exactly what it says on the tin, same with the print button. Just make sure all the images have loaded in the previews, or else some of the placards may not print correctly.


#### Details
The details for the placards are edited in the cluster of inputs below the title. The only issue with this is the school footer, where if you want to change it from the default (Which I don't see why you would) you have to enter the school name and hit enter. The upload button is for uploading a custom crest, and the remove button removes both crest and school name all together. It toggles to reset mode once you remove it so it's not the end of the world if you accidentally click it. Everything else is pretty self explanatory and you could learn from experimentation.

#### <a id="head1234"></a> Shortened Country Name
The country names that are stored are shortened. This means, that characters are abreviated where possible, and words that add nothing to the country name are removed.</br>
For example, **Central African Republic** would become **CAR**, **Vatican City** would become **Vatican** and **North Korea** would be **NKorea** 

(Note: Some countries are abbreviated even when they are not in the shortened version E.g, DPRK.)
